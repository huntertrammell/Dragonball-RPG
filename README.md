# Dragonball RPG

Thanks for checking out my version of the StarWars RPG game created using html, css, and Jquery (original version here https://drive.google.com/file/d/14vgXirIzSrfGQn_EtmazWCzF0X0zNJk3/view?usp=sharing).

The goal of this game is to defeat all fighters without being defeated on a single run. Each fighter has different health, attack points, and counter attack points.

When the player selects their fighter the attack points are displayed and when the opponent is chosen the counter attack points are displayed. Counter attack will always be higher than base attack.

After every attack, the players attack points double. The goal is to fight a player with a lower attack first, then move on up the chain. 

You will be able to win with each player just as you can loose with each player. The order that you fight will determine if you can win

To begin playing read the instructions on the prompt and click anywhere to begin.

You will now select any player to be your fighter. 

After fighter has been chosen you will select your opponent.

To battle - click 'FIGHT!' and this will generate an attack sequence that will show you game battle stats in a text box.

after a fighter has been defeated you choose another until all have been defeated.




The purpose of this game is to test my knowledge in jquery and apply what i have learned previously.
